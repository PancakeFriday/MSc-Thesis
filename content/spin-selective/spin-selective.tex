\chapter{Spin-selective imaging}
\label{ch:spin_resolved}
\subsection*{General idea and length}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Explain problem, that is: No idea which spins are occupying the tweezers. (1 page)
	\item Reference back to aod setup and explain that we use the same tweezers to select the spins (1-2 pages)
	\item Theory about spin selecting, could also say something about the first idea that didn't work out (2-4 pages)
	\item Explain in full detail the laser setup (1-2 pages)
	\item Show laser curve, maybe laser diode specs (1-2 pages)
	\item Then all the cavity stuff, which is how we built it and why we decided to use the materials. (4-5 pages)
	\item Then show drift measurements, explaining how beating works (1-2 pages)
	\item Conclude with outlook on building it in? (1-2 pages)
\end{itemize}
