\paragraph{Abstract}

This thesis presents systems towards quantum manybody effects. Part of these are acousto-optically deflected tweezers, in order to dynamically move atoms. Two implementations for the tweezers are discussed, where for one, atoms are rearranged to deterministically achieve $100\%$ filling across a tweezer grid, allowing to study correlations in more detail. Moreover, the dynamic tweezers allow for a spin-selective imaging approach, where a spin-sensitive laser beam traps only one spin state and moves it away from the other, thereby identifying the spin based on an image. Moreover, a system is discussed to increase the power available during loading of atoms into tweezers, ultimately paving the way to increase the available number of tweezers.
