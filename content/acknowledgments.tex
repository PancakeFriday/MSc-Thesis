\addchap{Acknowledgements}

Working on this master's project has been a fantastic experience and I want to thank everyone involved. I am very thankful for the possibility of exploring nature in the most interesting way. There are still some exciting years ahead of me that I am looking forward to, however reaching this milestone is a great achievement that I am very proud of.

For the people who have supported me in reaching this step, I am very thankful. In this vein, my family is first on the list, as they have encouraged me to proceed on this path and have always supported me no matter my choices. I also want to thank Karsten at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum optics, who I worked with prior to this thesis. He has helped me become familiar with the institute and provided a workplace I felt comfortable with, while encouraging me to work here on a thesis.
Then of course I want to thank all people involved in the Potassium group, Lorenzo, Niko, Lea and Philip with whom I have enjoyed working with very much for the last year. Thank you Christian, for allowing me to be part of this group, for the fruitful discussions and for supervising this thesis. I'm looking forward to the next few years with everyone.

And finally, thank you Meli, for being there for me during every part of the study and helping me go through all the difficult times.
